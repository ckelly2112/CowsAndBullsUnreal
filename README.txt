Bulls and Cows Unreal Edition

(READ FIRST: If you read nothing else remember this: Press <Alt+F4> to exit the game and <Tab> to Interact with the sign)

Install Instructions:

	Simply download the Alpha 0.1 Folder, unzip the 7z file, and Run the .exe File

Game Instructions:

	The Game is called Bulls and Cows!
	Guess the Isogram of Varying length.
	You have a limited amount of attempts

	If you get a letter correct, but in the wrong place, you will get a "Cow"
	If you get a letter correct and also in the right place, you will get a "Bull"

	Guess the word completely to Win!

Notes:

	As this is my first ever Unreal project, many things have not been implemented in version 0.1 (And may never will)
	Currently, there is no player mesh. So there is no point in exploring the game space.

	In order to interact with the terminal(SIGNPOST) simply press <Tab>

	In order to exit the game press <Alt + F4>

	Thank you for playing!!!
